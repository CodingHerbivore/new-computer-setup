# Andrew's fresh install setup script
Meant for setting up my computer with the stuff I use, this script first runs through manual installers in EXE or MSI format. After that, it installs Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) and uses it to run through a bunch of automated installs. Finally, since I use WSL to have a Linux environment for PHP development (and Django if I ever get the patience to sit down and learn it) the script installs WSL.

# TO-DOs
- Add in my EXE/MSI installers
- Change color of my injected comments so they stand out more in the Powershell screen
- Reboot afterwards to finish WSL install
